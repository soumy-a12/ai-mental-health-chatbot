# AI Mental Health Chatbot ðŸ¤–ðŸ§ 

This project is a concept-level conversational AI chatbot built using OpenAI's GPT-3.5 API and Flask. It is designed to simulate supportive, empathetic conversations for users dealing with stress, anxiety, or loneliness â€” not as a replacement for therapy, but as a gentle first step toward mental health support.

While the codebase is not uploaded, this project demonstrates my ability to integrate large language models (LLMs) into real-world applications, manage prompt design, build backend APIs, and create lightweight frontend interfaces for interactive AI tools.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
- Python
- Flask (for RESTful API and backend)
- OpenAI GPT-3.5 API
- HTML/CSS & JavaScript (for chat UI)
- Firebase Hosting (for frontend deployment)

## ðŸ’¡ Features
- Conversational AI powered by OpenAIâ€™s GPT API
- Prompt-tuned for emotional tone and supportive responses
- Simple chat interface using JavaScript & HTML
- Real-time Flask backend for routing messages and responses
- Designed with ethical prompts and disclaimers for mental health use

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Learning Outcomes
- Integrated GPT-3.5 API with Flask and built REST endpoints
- Learned prompt engineering strategies for emotionally nuanced responses
- Developed a clean and simple chatbot UI using JS/HTML
- Explored deployment using Firebase for static hosting

## ðŸ§  Future Scope
- Add session memory using Redis
- Integrate user analytics (anonymous)
- Expand to multi-language support using translation APIs

## ðŸ“Œ Note
This project was developed as a prototype to demonstrate LLM integration and product-thinking in AI applications. Due to privacy and scope limitations, code is not published â€” but Iâ€™m happy to walk through the architecture or recreate a demo on request.
